# RAG System Evaluation and Performance Documentation

## Red Team Testing

Our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system undergoes rigorous red team testing to ensure security, robustness, and reliability. The testing methodology includes:

1. **Adversarial Query Testing**: We systematically test the system with deliberately challenging or adversarial queries designed to:
   - Trick the system into providing hallucinated information
   - Extract sensitive information not present in the knowledge base
   - Force the system to go beyond its intended scope
   - Test boundary conditions and edge cases

2. **Prompt Injection Testing**: We evaluate the system's resilience against prompt injection attacks by:
   - Attempting direct prompt injection through user queries
   - Testing system responses to manipulative instructions
   - Checking for unwanted behavior when given conflicting directives

3. **Robustness Testing**: We assess the system's ability to:
   - Handle malformed or ambiguous queries
   - Maintain consistent performance under high load
   - Properly reject inputs that violate content policies
   - Recover gracefully from unexpected errors

4. **Comprehensive Logging**: All red team testing activities are comprehensively logged and analyzed to:
   - Identify patterns of vulnerability
   - Track improvements over time
   - Create regression testing suites for continuous evaluation

## Ranking Output with Reward Models

Our approach to ranking and optimizing system outputs leverages sophisticated reward models:

1. **Multi-Dimensional Reward Model**: Our system employs a specialized reward model trained to evaluate responses based on:
   - Factual accuracy and faithfulness to retrieved content
   - Relevance to the user's query
   - Completeness of information coverage
   - Clarity and coherence of presentation

2. **RLHF Integration**: The reward model is integrated with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback to:
   - Continuously improve response quality based on human evaluator ratings
   - Optimize for responses that best satisfy user intent
   - Reduce hallucination and improve information accuracy

3. **Reranking Mechanism**: Retrieved documents undergo a two-stage ranking process:
   - Initial relevance ranking based on vector similarity
   - Secondary contextual reranking using the LLMChainExtractor with specific thresholds
   - Final ranking adjustments based on reward model predictions

4. **Online Learning**: The system incorporates a feedback loop that:
   - Captures explicit and implicit user feedback
   - Adjusts retrieval and generation parameters based on user interactions
   - Continuously updates the reward model to reflect evolving quality criteria

   - Secondary content-based filtering using LLM judgment
   - Final relevance verification before response delivery

2. **Faithfulness Enforcement**:
   - Strict grounding of responses in retrieved documents
   - LLM instructions designed to prevent hallucination
   - Explicit source attribution within responses when appropriate
